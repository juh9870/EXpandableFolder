Hi. Excellent work and idea here, thank youjuh9870. I just molded your code and now it has Drag&Drop capabilities and the ability to go back to previous folder with middle mouse action in directory icon or forward to show child folders. It means that you can go from c:\ to any child folder with left mouse action and return to its parents directories all the way back to c:\ or even to "My Computer" again. You can still use right mouse action to open folder in explorer window or left mouse action to execute a file or program. Now it also shows thumbnail pictures tiles for image files and not its program icon. there is no need now for the user to specifies a path in variables.inc
A little problem though, there is a bug especially when changing disks when you go back to "My Computer" root directory and pick other disk, but once you go back to %USERPROFILE%, it then behaves normally. It started to happen when I integrated back and forward functionality and only few times when you go all the way back to "My Computer" or going to windows directory. It doesn't happen all the time, just once on a while. At one point or another it will either not show all items in the folder, show too many, or create incrementally more icons than needed.
It might be the follow path approach or something from the Lua scripts, I'm not sure.
